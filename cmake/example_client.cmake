# This file is meant as an example CMakeLists.txt of how to build a client from the installed UMD artifacts.
# It also contains some default third party dependencies that might be needed by the client, but are needed for some UMD 'clients' such as tools and examples.
# You can copy some parts or whole CMake configuration from this file to your client's CMakeLists.txt file.

# We have to manually add all third_party dependencies here since we are building from install artifacts
