/**
 * SysmemBuffer class should represent the resource of the HOST memory that is visible to the device.
 * Currently, there are two types of sysmem buffers:
 * 1. Hugepage-based sysmem buffer, that represents old system memory scheme used, that we still want to support until
 * transition to IOMMU is complete.
 * 2. Sysmem buffer, that is used when the system is protected by an IOMMU. With IOMMU, the mappings can be requested at
 * much finer granularity than hugepages.
 *
 * Traditionally, we have referred to the sysmem buffer as something that is
 * visible to device, has its own NOC address. Without changes to KMD, this is still not fully supported for IOMMU
 * buffers.
