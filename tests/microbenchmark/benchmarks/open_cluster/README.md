# Cluster open benchmark

This benchmark contains tests that are measuring performance of opening/constructing Cluster object. Since work done in the cluster objects is non-trivial, it is important to measure how long it takes to open the cluster and how long it takes to construct the Cluster object. This should run on all our configurations.
