# TLB benchmark

This benchmark contains tests that are measuring performance of multiple usages of TLBs inside UMD.

To get better understanding of what TLBs are, you can look at [Tenstorrent ISA documentation](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-isa-documentation/blob/main/WormholeB0/PCIExpressTile/TLBs.md) about it.
